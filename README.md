## About GreenHub BatteryHub

BatteryHub is a simple way to keep up with your device's battery details. The app works as a battery monitor compiling all useful information necessary for you to identify any energy anomalies. Keep in mind that the app by itself is NOT a battery saver, at least for now. It simply aggregates data to keep you informed of the battery details.

Use BatteryHub to:
- Monitor your battery details in real-time such as instant consumption and battery temperature and more.
- Check your device specifications, network information, storage details and memory usage.
- Find out what apps are running and how much memory they are using.
- Keep track of your battery state history with interactive charts with different time intervals.

**Disclaimer:** This app is still under development and it is NOT finished. Updates will be released over time with new content.

BatteryHub is a fork of the Carat Project and is part of the project *GreenHub*.

## What is GreenHub?

 > A collaborative approach to power consumption analysis of Android devices.
 
 It collects anonymous data about your devices's power consumption and uploads them to our server.

## Build Instructions

### Gradle

#### Linux and Mac OS:

Make sure `gradlew` is executable, by typing this command:
```shell
$ chmod +x gradlew
```

You can now build and test the project:
```shell
$ ./gradlew clean check assembleDebug
```

#### Windows:

```shell
$ gradlew.bat clean check assembleDebug
```

### Docker

If it is the first time building the Android app with Docker, it is necessary to build a local Docker image before running it. Afterwards just run a container:

**Note:** Make sure you have at least 2GB free storage on your workstation to build the docker image.

```shell
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmatalonga/docker-android/master/Dockerfile -sSf | docker build -t greenhub-project/batteryhub -f - .
$ docker run -it --name container-name \         # Choose a container name
-v `pwd`:/usr/src/app \                          # DO NOT change this src path
greenhub-project/batteryhub \
/bin/bash
```
Inside the container you can now run gradle tasks, for example:

```shell
./gradlew clean check assembleDebug  # This will create a debug build after passing all checks
```

To start an existing container, type:
```shell
$ docker start -i container-name
```

One line build, for copy-paste:
```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmatalonga/docker-android/master/Dockerfile -sSf | docker build -t greenhub-project/batteryhub -f - . && docker run -it --name batteryhub-app -v `pwd`:/usr/src/app greenhub-project/batteryhub /bin/bash
```

To list all available gradle tasks run `./gradlew tasks`.
